ROC curve for finding the optimal threshold: A receiver operating characteristics or known as ROC curve is a two-dimensional plot that illustrates how well a classifier system works as the discrimination cut-off value is changed over the range of the predictor variable. The X-axis or independent variable is the false positive rate for the predictive test. The Y-axis or dependent variable is the true positive rate for the predictive test. It is relevant to note that the nearer to the upper-left side of ROC space, the better a classifier is.
